Computer Programming: 2
Math: 3
Statistics: 4
Machine Learning: 2
Domain Expertise: 4 (If this is also considered as an SME and we're evaluating sectors, I'd say my strongest are Internal Audits, Transportation, Safety, Compliance, and Military genres)
Communication and Presentation Skills: 5
Data Visualization: 3

I believe that I will improve most in computer programming and applying statistics to these problems.
